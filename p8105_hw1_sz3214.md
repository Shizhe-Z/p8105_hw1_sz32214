# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
```

`species`: Penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)

`island`: The island in the Palmer Archipelago (Biscoe, Dream,
Torgersen)

`bill_length_mm`: Length of the penguin’s bill in millimeters

`bill_depth_mm`: Depth of the penguin’s bill in millimeters

`flipper_length_mm`: Length of the penguin’s flipper in millimeters

`body_mass_g`: Penguin body mass in grams

`sex`: Penguin’s sex (male, female)

The dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length of the penguins is 200.9152047 mm, after
accounting for missing data.

``` r
plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)", color = "Species")

ggsave("penguinscatter.png", plot = plot)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

creat a data frame

``` r
numeric = rnorm(10)

logical = numeric > 0

character = sample(letters, 10, replace = TRUE)

factor = factor(sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), 10, replace = TRUE))

df = data.frame(numeric, logical, character, factor)
```

Calculate the mean

``` r
mean(pull(df, numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.427273

``` r
mean(pull(df, logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(df, character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Numeric and logical variables works while character and factor don’t
work.

``` r
df_numeric = mutate(df, 
    logical_vals = as.numeric(logical),
    character_vals = as.numeric(character),  
    factor_vals = as.numeric(factor)  
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `character_vals = as.numeric(character)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

There is a warning about character variable. Because converting
characters to numeric typically results in NA since there’s no inherent
numeric mapping for arbitrary text strings.

It can explain why NA happened when took the mean of character variable.
